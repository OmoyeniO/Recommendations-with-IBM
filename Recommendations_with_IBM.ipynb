These tasks are beyond what is required for this project.  However, from what you learned in the lessons, you certainly capable of taking these tasks on to improve upon your work here!\n",

    "\n",
    "> Before you submit your project, you need to create a .html or .pdf version of this notebook in the workspace here. To do that, run the code cell below. If it worked correctly, you should get a return code of 0, and you should see the generated .html file in the workspace directory (click on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Alternatively, you can download this report as .html via the **File** > **Download as** submenu, and then manually upload it into the workspace directory by clicking on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left, then using the Upload button.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once you've done this, you can submit your project by clicking on the \"Submit Project\" button in the lower right here. This will create and submit a zip file with this .ipynb doc and the .html or .pdf version you created. Congratulations! "
